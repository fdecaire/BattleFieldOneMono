# BattleFieldOneMono

To compile this program, you'll need to build the project and attempt to run the first time.  Then a content directory will be made in the Debug directory (\BattlefieldOneMono\BattlefieldOneMono\bin\Windows\x86\Debug\Content).  Copy the two Arial (Arial6.xnb and Arial10.xnb) files from the \BattlefieldOneMono\Content directory into the Debug\Content directory and it should run.  This is a workaround for VS2019.
